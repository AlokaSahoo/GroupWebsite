## How to Use
### Maintenance & Updates
Utilize GitHub for hassle-free updates. The template uses markdown for pages and Liquid for dynamic elements. Key information like publications, news, and team profiles is stored in `.yml` format within the `_data` folder, simplifying the process of keeping your site current.

### Getting Set Up
Begin by familiarizing yourself with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub, the platform hosting your site. To start, fork the [GroupWebsite repository](https://github.com/danishfurkh/GroupWebsite), rename it to your GitHub username, and set up a `gh-pages` branch for your site's publication.

### Local vs. GitHub Editing
You can choose to edit directly on GitHub for ease or locally with Jekyll for more extensive customization. The GitHub desktop app is recommended for synchronizing your local changes with your GitHub repository.

## Customization Steps
1. **Update Data**: Edit the `.yml` files in the `_data` folder with your group's news, publications, and team information.
2. **Modify Pages**: Adjust content in the `_pages` folder and update layout elements like the homepage title, footer, and header as necessary.
3. **Style & Theme**: Customize the style by modifying or replacing the Bootstrap/Bootswatch files in the `_sass` directory. Use the `main.sass` file in the CSS folder for minor tweaks.
