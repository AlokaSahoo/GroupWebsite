Group Website Template
Overview: This template is crafted with Jekyll, incorporating Bootstrap and Bootswatch to offer a straightforward yet customizable solution for academic research groups looking to establish an online presence. Designed for ease of adaptation and maintenance, it provides a solid foundation for showcasing your group's work.

How to Use:

Maintenance & Updates: Leveraging GitHub for straightforward updates, the template features markdown pages and Liquid for dynamic content. Data for publications, news, and team members are stored as .yml files in the _data folder, simplifying the update process.
Getting Set Up: Familiarize yourself with Jekyll and GitHub for hosting. Fork the repository to create your version, renaming it to match your GitHub username and setting up a gh-pages branch for publishing.
Local vs. GitHub Editing: Start editing directly on GitHub for convenience or set up Jekyll locally for more comprehensive changes. Consider using the GitHub desktop app for syncing changes.
Customization Steps:

Update Data: Modify .yml files within the _data folder (news, publications, team) to reflect your content.
Modify Pages: Adjust the content in the _pages folder and other layout elements like the homepage title, footer, and header as needed.
Adjust Style & Theme: Feel free to alter the style by updating or replacing Bootstrap/Bootswatch files in the _sass directory. For minor tweaks, the main.sass file in the CSS folder is your go-to.
